# Python_Pickle
Pickling and Unpickling:   Pickling means serializing and de-serializing any Python object. So pickling means saving any python object on  computer hard disk.  Pickling is a way to convert a python object (list, dict, etc.) into a character stream. The idea is that this character stream contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the object in another python script   Python3 has module pickle and Python2.7 cPickle .  I have attached the file just simply run it with from CMD prompt … python filename.py.   Entire Object python class functions definitions can be dumped to file and can be resused Anything you want can be dumped in a file like object

First run the store_data to create the pickle file and then laoddata to read from pickle file.
